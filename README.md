A react app that allows you to view and upload deconstructed art pieces by scrolling through them. The react app connects to a node.js backend which is in turn connected to a mysql database containing information about the artwork. The actual images — both those the app displays and those that the user can upload — are stored in Amazon S3. The database stores links to the S3 bucket, and an AWS policy ensures that only the app can interact with the bucket. The react app, node app, and mysql database live on an amazon ec2 instance accessible via an nginx reverse proxy. The node app uses the aws sdk to interact with S3.

Important frontend dependencies: dropzone for image drag and drop uploads, react-router-dom.
